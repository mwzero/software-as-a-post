# Software as a Post

This repository collects practical examples of **Software as a Post**: applications, pipelines, and micro-tools built as a natural extension of an article, a blog post, or a shared idea.

The goal is to explore a different way of building software:

> 👉 not documentation *about* code — but code *born from* content.

Each folder in this repo corresponds to a post (Medium, blog, or technical notes) and typically contains:

* source code of the experiment
* sample datasets (when needed)
* AI prompts or workflows used
* instructions for local execution
* minimal architectural notes

Examples are intentionally:

* **small**
* **reproducible**
* **local-first**
* optimized for fast learning
* designed as *building blocks*, not finished products

## Philosophy

*Software as a Post* means:

* turning an idea into something executable in hours
* using LLMs as accelerators, not black boxes
* favoring working prototypes over heavy frameworks
* merging narrative, code, and results into a single artifact

Each project starts from a concrete question (“Can this run locally?”, “Do I really need a backend?”, “How much code is actually required?”) and answers it with real software.

## What you’ll find here

Depending on the related post:

* NLP mini-pipelines (sentiment, clustering, NER)
* CLI tools
* micro frontends
* agentic workflows
* local-LLM experiments
* SaaS prototypes
* executable entrepreneurial ideas

## Who this repo is for

* curious developers
* makers
* software architects
* AI + product explorers
* anyone who prefers learning by building

If you believe a post can become software — this repo is for you.
